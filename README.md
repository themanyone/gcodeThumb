# gcodeThumb
Extracts thumbnails from `.gcode` headers, or renders them if not present.

Includes configuration of file managers to show embedded previews.

## Optional configuration.
You may optionally configure slicers to embed thumbnails.
If embedded thumbnails are present, `gcodeThumb.py` will extract them. They aren't necessary though.
  * PrusaSlicer-2.3.3 Look under Printer Settings and set G-Code thumbnails to 128x128, or the size of your printer display.
  * Older versions may need to [edit the ini files](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Prusa+printer.ini+embed+thumbnails&ia=web)
  * [Configure Cura](https://github.com/Razor10021990/SnapmakerGcodeWriter)

This example shows an embedded thumbnail (orange) alongside our generated thumbnails (blue).

## Limitations
The code takes colossal shortcuts to minimize memory usage and dependencies. The parser doesn't support curves perfectly. It treats them as lines. The renderer fakes 3D by subtracting Y-Z. The shader is literally just layer height. But that's not all. Tracing the path of print head moves from gcode introduces unavoidable artifacts, including "layer lines," "skirts," "brims," and "purge towers." If the results are unsatisfactory, configure slicers to embed previews.

Written with Linux in mind. The Python parts should work on Windows, though. If not, [report an issue](https://github.com/themanyone/gcodeThumb/issues) ‚è´ 

## Requirements
Python3. PIL image library.

## Installation

   * edit `inst.sh` and `uninst. sh` with your preferred install locations.
   * Many users prefer to install to ~/.local/share/thumbnailers/

`inst.sh`

   * Clear cache to regenerate thumbnails.

`rm -rf ~/.cache/thumbnails`

Thunar requires `tumbler` to generate thumbnails.

Other file managers, like `pcmanfm` and `nautilus`, should work now.

## Troubleshooting

If no thumbnails are generated, follow the above instruction to clear the thumbnail cache. If it still doesn't work, edit the "MimeType=" line in `/usr/share/thumbnailers/gcode.thumbnailer`. Use `grep -i gcode /usr/share/mime/*` to discover what mimetypes the system is using and try those. Refer to `https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/` for complete documentation.

Sometimes GTK bugs out, and it becomes necessary to update its icon cache as well.

`gtk-update-icon-cache ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/ -t`

## Adding on

From the mime info documentation above, you can add thumbnail support for other gcode-like file extensions, such as `*.gc` and `*.nc` by first creating a file called `Override.xml` in `~/.local/share/mime/` like so:

```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mime-info xmlns="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info">
    <mime-type type="text/gcode">
        <sub-class-of type="text/plain"/>
        <comment>Gcode file</comment>
        <icon name="unknown"/>
        <glob-deleteall/>
        <glob pattern="*.gcode"/>
        <glob pattern="*.g"/>
        <glob pattern="*.gc"/>
        <glob pattern="*.nc"/>
    </mime-type>
 </mime-info>
 ```
Then run `update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime` to see them.
